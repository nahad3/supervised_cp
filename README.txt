The mai _run.py can be used to run the code

The code would require setting the path to the correct datasets.


Main requirements are

Python 3.8.11 with the following packages
PyTorch 1.8.0
CUDA 11.0
Numpy
Scikit learn



A non-pytorch version (manual gradients) version of this work has been coded too, but would need more reorganizing before it could be shared. We hope to do that in the future.
